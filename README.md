# ECE-Paris---Deep-Learning-Challenge---2019

In this challenge you will be building a model that automatically determines logical entailment between two sentences.

You are free to handle the data as you wish, though your final submission file must be reproductible using solely your model.

The size of the dataset is acceptable enough to be processed correctly by your personal computer. That being said, it could be helpful to profit from free cloud computing services, like Kaggle kernels or Google Colab.

Any cheating strategies, like manually labelling the test dataset, would lead to a disqualification and a minimal final grade.

Remember that final evaluation will be based on ranking, quality of code and ideas.

## Goal
The goal of this InClass competition is to predict the right animal for each image. Note that the dataset is clearly balanced between all the classes. For every Id in the test set, you should predict the correct Category which is basically the name of the animal predicted.

## Metric
Since the dataset is balanced, this competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of animals you get correct).

## Submission Format
For each Id in the test set, you must predict a Category.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:


Id,Category
0,bee
1,lion
2,kangaroo
3,wolf
etc.
